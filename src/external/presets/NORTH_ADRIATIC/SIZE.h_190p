C  These lines are here to deliberately cause a compile-time error.
C  If you see these lines in your .F files or the compiler shows them
C  as an error then it means you have not placed your configuration
C  files in the appropriate place.
C  You need to place you own copy of SIZE.h in the include
C  path for the model, and comment out these lines.

C     *==========================================================*
C     | SIZE.h Declare size of underlying computational grid.     
C     *==========================================================*
C     | The design here support a three-dimensional model grid    
C     | with indices I,J and K. The three-dimensional domain      
C     | is comprised of nPx*nSx blocks of size sNx along one axis 
C     | nPy*nSy blocks of size sNy along another axis and one     
C     | block of size Nz along the final axis.                    
C     | Blocks have overlap regions of size OLx and OLy along the 
C     | dimensions that are subdivided.
